## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Xcode 16.0+** 
- **iOS/iPadOS 18.0+** or **macOS 15.0+**
- **Swift 5.9+**
- **Darwin ARM64** architecture (Apple Silicon optimized)

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lithalean/AudioPlayer.git
cd AudioPlayer
open AudioPlayer.xcodeproj
```

**Build and run** for your desired platform:
- **iPhone/iPad**: Select iOS Simulator or device
- **Mac**: Select "My Mac (Designed for iPad)" for Mac Catalyst

## Usage

### 🎯 **Getting Started**
1. **Launch the app** - You'll see the document browser interface
2. **Create or open** - Start with a new document or open existing
3. **Start creating** - Use intuitive gestures and controls

### ⌨️ **Controls**
- **Primary Action**: Tap/click to interact with elements
- **Secondary Action**: Double-tap for detailed editing
- **Navigation**: Drag to pan, pinch/scroll to zoom
- **Multi-Select**: Use modifier keys for multiple selection

### 🖥️ **Platform-Specific Features**
- **iPad**: Full toolbar with controls and document info
- **iPhone**: Floating action buttons for compact interface
- **Mac**: Native Mac toolbar with proper window management

### 💾 **Documents**
- **Auto-save**: Documents save automatically as you work
- **File Format**: Human-readable JSON for version control
- **Sharing**: Standard iOS/macOS sharing for export
- **Templates**: Built-in templates for common use cases

## Technical Architecture

### Modern SwiftUI Stack
- **`@Observable`** for reactive state management
- **`ReferenceFileDocument`** for document persistence  
- **`Canvas`** for high-performance rendering
- **`GeometryReader`** for adaptive layouts
- **`NavigationSplitView`** for native platform navigation
