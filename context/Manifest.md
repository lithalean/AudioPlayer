## Context Loading Strategy

### For Bug Fixes
1. IMPLEMENTATION.md (current state & known issues)
2. session.json (active bugs & blockers)
3. ARCHITECTURE.md (design constraints)

### For New Features
1. ARCHITECTURE.md (design patterns & constraints)
2. NAVIGATION.md (user flow & platform specifics)
3. VISUAL.md (UI requirements & glass effects)
4. IMPLEMENTATION.md (integration points)

### For SwiftData Issues
1. ARCHITECTURE.md (SwiftData relationship patterns)
2. EVOLUTION.md (AlbumDetailView removal decision)
3. IMPLEMENTATION.md (current workarounds)

### For Platform-Specific Work
1. ARCHITECTURE.md (platform divergence strategy)
2. IMPLEMENTATION.md (platform feature matrix)
3. NAVIGATION.md (platform-specific flows)
4. INTEGRATION.yaml (platform capabilities)

### For Metadata Editing (Current Priority)
1. IMPLEMENTATION.md (current SwiftData status)
2. ARCHITECTURE.md (binding patterns)
3. session.json (active tasks)

### For tvOS Focus Issues (Active Bug)
1. IMPLEMENTATION.md (known focus jumping issue)
2. NAVIGATION.md (focus engine details)
3. VISUAL.md (tvOS-specific adaptations)

## Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Impact | Documentation |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| M4A Format Exclusivity | Defines entire app philosophy | ARCHITECTURE.md + EVOLUTION.md |
| SwiftData Relationship Workarounds | Shapes data layer patterns | ARCHITECTURE.md + IMPLEMENTATION.md |
| Platform Divergence (iOS/tvOS/macOS) | User experience per platform | ARCHITECTURE.md + NAVIGATION.md |
| Remove AlbumDetailView | Navigation simplification | EVOLUTION.md + NAVIGATION.md |
| AVAudioPlayer First | Playback stability | ARCHITECTURE.md + EVOLUTION.md |
